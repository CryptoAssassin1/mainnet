# Stride's Network

![Stride](assets/stride-banner.png)

This contains instructions for how to connect to Stride!

We've tried to keep the instructions as simple as possible, but if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us over [email](mailto:hello@stridelabs.co), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stride_zone), or at our [Discord](https://stride.zone/discord).

Requirements for running a node are fairly minimal. You should have a 4 CPU 32 GB RAM machine. We've only tested this build on OSX and Linux machines, but we hope to support Windows soon.


## Installation

We'll release a more detailed connection script soon, but for now, look at the [chain registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/tree/master/stride) for connection info for Stride. A quick summary:

    chain-id = stride-1
    stride hash = bba22626728961a5a2329031aa34c0140ed76b54
    genesis file = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stride-Labs/testnet/main/mainnet/genesis.json

## Being a Validator

We are hoping to release a more detailed validator guide later. For now, we strongly recommend running a setup with a Sentry node and signed using [Horcrux](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/horcrux).

We recommend validators have a minimum 8 CPU 64 GB RAM machines.
